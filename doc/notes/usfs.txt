USFS campgrounds are stored in a somewhat complicated hierarchy:
1. use a AJAX call to get the list of states with national forests
2. then use an ajax call to get a list of national forests per state
3. the list includes URLs to each NF page
4. The NF landing page contains a link to a "Recreation" page for the NF
5. That page contains a link to "Camping & Cabins"
6. The "C & C" page contains links to various types of accomodations: "Cabin Rentals", "Campground Camping",
   "Group Camping," and "RV Camping" (not all may be present)
7. Each one of these pages contains a list of campground (or other accomodations). This list is
   hierarchical, with headings like "so and so Ranger District" or "so and so Area". The campgrounds are
   typically (but unfortunately not always) at the leaf nodes. The HTML itself is just a flat <li> list,
   and the hierarchical effect is provided by changing the margin-right as needed.
8. Each <li> contains a link to a details page, which has things like the campground's location and
   "At a Glance" information.

The scrubber needs to walk this page hierarchy in order to extract campground data.

Note: The Recreation page also has a "OHV Riding & Camping" link that we may want to follow.
      But maybe not; it doesn't seem to lead to campgrounds.
Note: Alabama's Nonecuh National Forest 'Camping & Cabins' page only has 'Campground Camping'
      and 'RV Camping' entries (since other types of accomodations are not available).
Note: Also, all forests in AL are linked to a single page that covers 'National Forests in Alabama'
      and the campgrounds are arranged under specific national forest headings in the list e.g.
      Talladega National Forest
        Shoal Creek Ranger District
          Coleman Lake Recreation Area
This means that the scrubber will think that all campgrounds in AL reside in the last NF loaded.
