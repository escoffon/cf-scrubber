The state park coordinates can be obtain via a call to
http://oregonstateparks.org/cfcs/shared/format.cfc?method=json&cfc=parks.parksData&function=findParksByDistance
The response contains JSON that lists park names and locations. It also lists park ID and two properties that
indicate whether or not the park allows camping and chanrges day use fees: overNight and duFees.

There are possibly other request parameters to get different slices of the park data.

The park detail page is at
    http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=<park_id>
where <park_id> is the park identifier

The index page has a find by feature/facility feature that seems to work a bit like the NV one.
Except it doesn't; this guy makes calls into the format.cfc API, passing the list of requested features
in the featureIds parameter.

To get the list of facilities for each park, we'll probably have to scrub the park's detail page.
There is a set of icons that summarizes the facilities. There's a div#park-carousel that displays park
images. The next element is a div.hidden-print that contains a <p> with a set of icons, like this:

<div id="park-carousel" class="park-carousel carousel slide">..</div>
<div class="hidden-print">
  <div class="text-muted">
    Symbols represent major park features and activities.&nbsp;
    Blue icons mean some or all are <abbr title="Americans with Disabilities Act">ADA</abbr> accessible.
  </div>
  <p class="clearfix">
    <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-camping" title="Camping"></a>
    <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-reservable" title="Reservable"></a>
    <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-hiking" title="Hiking Trails"></a>
    <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-dump" title="Dump Station"></a>

and so on. We can use thses to build the feature set for each park. There are ADA versions of icons:

  <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-camping-ada" title="Camping (ADA)"></a>
  <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-reservable" title="Reservable"></a>
  <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-hiking-ada" title="Hiking Trails (ADA)"></a>
  <a onclick="" class="park-guide-icon park-guide-icon-dump" title="Dump Station"></a>

Also if the park is reservable, the page also contains the reservation link.
